In this tutorial I will cover 1) the five main types of classification models and when to use them; 2) how to set up and clean data to use in classification machine learning, and 3) how to run models and compare the outcomes. I propose three different questions that could be answered with machine learning classification to showcase how the types of predictor and outcome variables you are working with impacts what models to run and with what [hyperparameters](#hyperparameters). (Throughout the tutorial, you'll see highlighted vocab terms like hyperparameters - click to see the definition and then click that word again to return to the text). The data used in this tutorial is from a team science open access dataset from the [Many Dogs Project](https://manydogsproject.github.io/), and the number and type of variables makes it an excellent example dataset to use with classification machine learning. For a more extensive description of the dataset please see the [data description](#sec2) section.\n\nThis tutorial is *not* meant to be an exhaustive list of what can be done with machine learning. I only cover supervised learning for binary classification problems. I do not cover any inductive processes like deep learning (aka neural nets), semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or how to deal with continuous dependent variables. See links within text for more detail on these applications.This tutorial also assumes you have a basic understanding of simple statistical concepts like distributions and categorical vs. continuous variables, and some exposure to basic models like linear regression. If the terms in that last sentence werenâ€™t familiar to you, check out the resources at [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/) for an introduction to statistics.\n\nThe following libraries are needed to run this tutorial in R. Before you code anything, make sure you have the following installed and updated. For further instruction on how to install and/or update packages visit the following [link](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/packages-r).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data wrangling\nlibrary(knitr) # for showing you pretty pictures and making tables\nlibrary(here) # for keeping track of where to get files needed for this tutorial\nlibrary(janitor) # for examining and cleaning data\nlibrary(ggpubr) # to make Q-Q plots for testing normality\nlibrary(car) # for making component plus resistance (CR) plots to check for linearity\nlibrary(mlr) # for doing machine learning in R!\nlibrary(parallelMap) # for running code using all of the available processing power on your computer\nlibrary(parallel) # for running code using all of the available processing power on your computer\nlibrary(randomForest) # for running the random forest algorithm\n```\n:::\n",
